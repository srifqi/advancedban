advancedban
===========
This mod will ban ONLY username, not the ip address.

# Usage

	advancedban.ban(player_name)

	or using chat commands:

	/advancedban <player>

This will add player to advancedban list.
This does NOT kick the player!

## Parameter
- FILE_NAME = the name of file that contains list of banned player.
- BAN_MESSAGE = the message that will be sent to the banned player each time the player log-in.
